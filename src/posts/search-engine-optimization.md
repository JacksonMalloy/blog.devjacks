A lot of agencies and businesses have the wrong idea when it comes to optimizing for search engines. Most people believe that if they just focus on the content of the webpage by defining all the right keywords, that they will rank high. This is usually not the case, and with an ever expanding presence of new competition online, doing so will likely get drowned out by the noise. What can we do differently?

## What is Search Engine Optimization?

Search engine optimization is the optimizations businesses make to their online web content to rank higher in search queries. An example of a search query is when a user submits an entry into Google's search input. Once that happens, a query is made, and an array of the most relevant responses return.

## The Search Engine Browsing Space

Within this space, there are many businesses that have tried and failed to keep up with Google. Google is by far the most dominant with over 90% of search queries happening on a Google property. Properties such as Google Images, Google Maps, Google Search, and Youtube dominate the search space. Professionals of all sorts just accept it as a normality. We must ask the question - Why is Google so dominant in this space and what is their founding vision/mission behind search engine optimization?

## Google's Mission

Google's mission is to organize the world's information and make it universally accessible and useful. That is significantly more broad than just serving up content based on relevant keywords. Of course, having relevent content that will engage consumers of data is important, but it's more about engaging the user, with the content, versus focusing solely on the content itself.

## 3 Pillars of Search Engine Optimization

As you may have been reading through the lines a bit, the key strategy for search engine optimization is focusing on the User Experience. Google wants to serve up the most relevant content to their users to maintain their competitive advantage, and to do so, they want their users to land on web pages that provide the best user experience possible. User experience is very broad so I am going to break it down into three main points.

### Performance

Bounce rate is a key factor in determining how users are reacting when landing on your website. How frequently are they Bouncing right when they see the landing page? The slower your website, the higher your bounce rate, the lower you will rank versus your competition. If you own a wordpress site that has no modern UI experience but has a lot of relevant content, you may be ranking high in search now, but in less than a year, competitors that build websites with modern front-end frameworks like React, Vue, Angular, Gatsby, etc will start to take over.

### User Interface

How the users interact with the content is very important. Is it easy to navigate your website? Are there errors with your responsive design? Does the interface look the same across browsers? These are some questions that will get you started in the right direction.

### Content

Last but not least, content. Content is crucial and critical, but it is becoming less and less as important as time goes on. The more competition in the marketplace for similar products and content, the less important content becomes.
